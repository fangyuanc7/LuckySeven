"Business Analyst","Efficio","New York","NY",""," Vacancy Name Business Analyst - New York Location City New York About Us Started in 2000, Efficio is a specialist management consultancy, focused on procurement and supply chain improvement programs. There are currently c.350 employees globally, with exciting plans to grow rapidly in the next 18 months. We are a truly international organisation with over 30 different languages spoken. The firm places a high value on its employees and offers great training and development opportunities, to help with career progression. Our consultants return to their home office each Friday from their client engagement to spend time with their colleagues and attend training courses. Description Given the growth that Efficio is going through, we are looking for Business Analysts (BAs) to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments.  Business Analysts roles are targeted at graduate entry level candidates and are the first step into management consulting.  Although based out of our New York office, our BAs will be on client site up to 4 days a week and therefore need to be flexible to travel.  Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, their key role is to collect, analyse and synthesise data from a variety of sources. The insights and understandings from their analysis provide important inputs to the project team's recommendations and solutions.  BAs also provide input to client presentations, and work with other team members on day-to-day delivery of projects - for example, they may assist with developing and issuing RFPs and evaluating proposals from suppliers. They interact with clients and their suppliers as needed.  BAs are typically involved in client facing projects at client sites from day one, so they need to be able to learn fast and get up to speed quickly and work effectively under pressure. They must be able to work independently, while also being team players who are willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.  BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas. However, they are also expected to be able to justify their conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous, fact-based analysis.  Efficio has a collaborative, supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. BAs are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme including formal training (through the Efficio Academy), on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunities and support that come from a role as an Efficio BA make it an unmatched springboard into a top-tier consulting career.

The ability to prioritise their work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.  BAs are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas.

"Management Consultant","The Berkeley Partnership","New York","NY","","When we ask someone to join The Berkeley Partnership, it’s a big decision, for us and for them. We work with big, high profile clients, shaping and delivering complex and transformational change. Our partners and consultants help these organisations tackle their most critical challenges, often by working as an integral part of their leadership teams. Our focus is always on making change happen, making it successful and making it last.Our people focus on building trusting, long term client relationships and only selling work that clients need and want. We truly believe this is key to our success, and our repeat/referral business supports this. That’s why we can’t afford to compromise on the quality of people we hire. At Berkeley we develop talented consultants rather than hire in at the most senior levels, so it is important to us that we hire people at the right point in their career. We look for high achievers with 7 – 12 years consulting experience working in high quality, often large consulting firms. Joiners will have a proven project leadership track record, and the ability to build strong relationships with blue-chip clients.  But meeting our requirements is only part of the story. Life at The Berkeley Partnership is very different from larger firms. With freedom, trust and autonomy comes a high level of accountability. This is by no means a soft option. There’s a strong focus on personal and professional development, with a partner to consultant ratio of 1:4. We don’t do hierarchy. There are just two levels, Partner and Consultant and if the offer of Partnership comes, you’ll know it means something.  Being owner-managed, we can shape the kind of firm we want to work in. We offer our consultants the chance to develop themselves professionally and to work towards success for our clients and for the firm. Our trusting and open culture makes Berkeley both a professional and sociable place to work, with high levels of autonomy and little bureaucracy. You’ll need to be adaptable and open minded about different ways of working and projects/industry sectors that are outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes you’ll be leading, sometimes supporting. Sometimes you’ll be on your own, although there’s always support from your colleagues when you need it. The pressure can be every bit as high as you’ve experienced before but most of our people find it easier to balance their work and personal interests in a smaller, more flexible firm.  You’ll find our recruitment process thorough and demanding but friendly too. We know it’s a big time commitment, so we urge you to read our website carefully before taking the next step. If you are the right person for us and are ready for a significant career move, it’s time well spent.  If you’d like to find out more about management consultancy careers at Berkeley, please visit our website.","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2502&ao=360588&s=58&guid=000001676541842abb4af8a79dbca612&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_9f80daba&cb=1543592052678&jobListingId=2616497361"
