There are literally thousands of consultancies and value-added resellers that make a living selling, implementing and supporting a relatively small number of business applications. Some are lifestyle businesses and others are global systems integrators, but the one element they all have in common is a working knowledge of the business applications they represent. What most partners are missing, however, is a deep vertical expertise that goes beyond the proverbial industry list on their web sites. This is the Sopris Difference.  It has been our experience, that no single attribute of a partner, more closely correlates with successful implementations, than deep industry expertise. And this belief has been validated by the growth rates and customer satisfaction that Sopris Systems has been able to attain over the last decade.
