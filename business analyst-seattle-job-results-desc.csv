"Product Analyst","MD Clarity","Seattle","WA",""," Job DescriptionMD Clarity Vision:We believe the healthcare experience should be simpler to understand and navigate for patients and the healthcare providers that serve them. From making it easier for patients to understand the cost of healthcare, to measuring and tracking the outcome of their experience, MD Clarity’s platform delivers cost-savings and increased patient satisfaction.MD Clarity has offices in Seattle and Atlanta and is used by healthcare providers that impact hundreds of thousands of patient visits annually. This is an opportunity to be part of a product team that is scaling up to address a growing user-base and an increased focus on the healthcare consumer experience. Our team is passionate about solving the complex problems in Healthcare and providing all members of our company an opportunity to make a lasting, meaningful impact through their work. We strive to foster a team environment which encourages rapid innovation, autonomy, taking risks, and having fun along the way.We are looking for people that fit with these core traits of our team:Always Look For Patterns: we get a lot of input from customers through several channels and it’s the patterns we recognize and act on that make a great product.Sweat Every Detail: every little thing counts in terms of a lasting impression for the product, customer, and team experience and we strive to excel at the detailsReason From First Principles: always try break down problems into their smallest components, question prior assumptions, and think from the ground up before immediately trying to solve complex problems.Team > Individual: celebrate each other’s accomplishments and always ask how you can helpAlways Ask Why: Why do we do things this way? Why does the customer need this? Be curious, ask questions, explore possibilitiesWhat can I do? What can I do to make the product better? To serve our customers better? To help improve our team? Suggest it! Chances are it’s a good idea.Key Responsibilities:We’ve put together our thoughts on the key responsibilities of the Product Analyst. Please read below to understand not only what we consider to be the key responsibilities but also some real-life examples we expect the Product Analyst will encounter.Listening and responding to our customers when they have questions about our product; consolidating common themes heard from our customers and funneling to your colleagues in Product & Account Management. Here’s an example of how this responsibility plays out in the day to day: Our customers are curious and ask us a lot of questions:Can the product currently do x?Would it be possible to add feature x?Can it help automate an existing process?Is it possible to expose an additional data element?Can a report be added?Some things that are truly issues or addressable requests may be triaged by you and resolved: for example, adding a new kind of report, updating some customer-specific workflow configuration, or working with Product Management and Account Management to prioritize a hotfix for a high-impact issue. Developing strong working relationships inside the MD Clarity team and with our customers; communicating effectively and taking action to support our customer’s use of the MD Clarity product.You are on the daily front-lines, along with Account Management, with our Customers, in our quest to build the best product for patients and doctors in Healthcare. Our ability to listen, interpret, and execute on the feedback we get is critically important for our success. We view support of our product as a process to learn from customers, give them exceptional service, and recognize patterns.Gathering, cleaning, analyzing and performing QA of large and complex data sets. One of the unique, complicated challenges our product solves is powering price transparency for patients, doctors, and healthcare staff. This involves an engine that we’ve created that can consume many attributes to determine the cost of any healthcare visit before it happens so that everyone is clearly informed. The process of collecting and transforming the data sources, which can come from websites, spreadsheets, and unstructured documents, to drive this capability is complex problem that we’re constantly striving to optimize and further automate. It often involves some not-so-glamorous data cleaning and transformation, but ultimately it leads to a powerful result that enables any doctor or patient to access accurate cost information for their healthcare before it happens. A good thing! That said, part of this role is to help clean/transform/qa that regular stream of data before pushing it into our pricing engine. You will be part of figuring out ways to optimize the process (because we are hungry to do it!), as it is a crucial task that helps power our customers’ success and the product’s success in achieving our mission.A few other things you’ll find yourself doing in some capacity:Along the lines of what was previously mentioned, you’ll be documenting patterns that you are noticing and communicating them to Account Management (to get more feedback from the customer on why a challenge exists and what could solve it) and ultimately helping to communicate what is needed to Product Management so it can get into the development roadmap. You’ll see it come full circle!Help with acceptance testing of new features, or releases, and potentially the configuration of these new features for customers in tandem with the Account Management teamAssist with the configuration and on-boarding of new customers, including transforming their pricing data and documents into our engineUse SQL to analyze and review patterns in customer’s data based on questions that come in via support ticketsBuild internal reports using SQL to track certain patterns, and build/publish custom reports to customers through our product that come from service requests.Generally, there are a couple paths of progression from this role. Either into Product Management, Account Management, or Engineering. Depends on what you like and have a knack for as you learn and grow. Plenty of people in MD Clarity have carved out roles for themselves that evolved organically from new challenges that needed to be solved.EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCEBachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or any general Engineering field (e.g. Industrial Engineering)Two years’ experience working as an analyst for a sales, product, or consulting teamExperience working with SQL and writing queries to generate reports, analyze patterns, etc.Experience in the healthcare field, specifically working with healthcare clinical or financial dataCan exhibit an understanding of how data-driven systems work…we’ll ask a lot of questions here!Experience with .NET framework or C# a bonusCompany DescriptionOur Mission is to ensure that every patient knows the cost and quality of care prior to any procedure.Our Software automates all things business related (revenue cycle) for medical groups.

"Senior Management Consultant","Caiman Consulting Corp","Seattle","WA","$120k-$140k(Employer Est.)","Greater Seattle candidates onlyWhat is Caiman looking for?Written by Talent Acquisition Senior Manager, Shari SparlingI get asked this question often. More often, I am asked “what skillset is Caiman looking for?”. We are not just looking for one particular skillset - I’ll take a generalist over a specialist any day!We are looking for critical thinkers - consultants with client-facing experience who can step back, take a look at the big picture, come up with creative solutions, and then help make things happen! Consultants who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds of a project.An article on Forbes.com recently discussed the importance of a “culture add” rather than a “culture fit”. We’re looking for people who share our values but also bring new kinds of voices to the table and help us build a diverse and inclusive workforce. Grit, rigor, impact, teamwork, project ownership, curiosity and polish are some of the words that come to mind.Often our consultants are working independently or on smaller teams and working directly with our clients. They do not require constant oversight from a manager. They are experts at adapting to new situations and ever-changing work environments. They have typically worked at management consulting firms (Big Four or mid-size) in client-facing roles and have the training, tools, and experience owning projects end-to-end. They have frequently managed executive level meetings or have presented to senior level client teams.In the Greater Seattle area, we hire more senior level consultants with client facing experience in Fortune 500 and/or technology organizations. They usually have Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), Project Management Professional (PMP), and/or Six Sigma certification. Our consultants are proficient with Project Management frameworks and methodologies and masters of PowerPoint and Excel.In the Greater Bay area, we look for a broader range of marketing skillsets – from Digital Marketers who have experience managing content strategy, curation, and execution of end-to-end social media campaigns – to Product Marketing Managers who have experience developing marketing plans and use cases for global product campaign launches. Our consultants have deep business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) marketing channel experience and have managed third party vendors such as creative agencies.Regardless of the region we’re doing business in and the skillset needed, all of our consultants need to have outstanding interpersonal, written, and verbal communication skills. In an interview, we’re assessing whether you can provide a brief summary of your experience. Our consultants are agile thinkers, team-oriented, and solution focused, so we’re also assessing your analytical skills and ability to read other people’s signals and react appropriately to them.We want to understand what you’re looking for in a company besides “work”. This isn’t about placing a consultant in a particular contract; we’re looking for more than that from our applicants. We are looking for people who like being consultants, who don’t consider it a second choice or an in-road to working for our client companies directly.Last, it’s important that you have interests and hobbies outside of being a consultant. Melinda Gates said recently, “Technology has made it harder to pull away from our jobs. And easier to wonder whether a night off or a long weekend is damaging our careers.” You’ll find that our team feels they have a good work/life balance here and we like to hire interesting people!If you choose to interview with our firm, please be prepared to provide examples of when your project or tasks suffered a setback – we’re not looking for perfection! Please be prepared to tell us about a time when you were asked to do something you had never done before. Tell us about your best or worst colleagues. And most importantly, be genuine, “be radically transparent”.About one-third of our working years is spent at work. We want to get to know you and we want you to have the opportunity to get to know us as we’ll be spending a lot of time together.Applicants must currently be located in the Greater Seattle Area. Applicants for employment must have work authorization that does not now or in the future require sponsorship of a visa for employment authorization in the United States and with Caiman Consulting i.e., H1-B visa, F-1 visa (OPT), TN visa or any other non-immigrant status).Forbs Article: https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.forbes.com/sites/larsschmidt/2017/03/21/the-end-of-culture-fit/amp/Melinda Gates Quote: https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/14131-melinda-gates-corporate-america-must-stop-demanding-we-all-be-workaholics?utm_source=Arianna&utm_medium=LinkedIn","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=1623&ao=409261&s=58&guid=0000016767a0de9687e03e9e32c5289d&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&aa=1&ea=1&cs=1_c2bdc035&cb=1543631855779&jobListingId=3041379684"

"Senior Data Analyst Engineer","ThriftBooks","Seattle","WA","$53k-$70k(Glassdoor Est.)"," DescriptionAbout ThriftBooks At its most basic, ThriftBooks is a Seattle-based data-driven online second-hand book store. That’s a mouthful. Let us explain …  We buy used books that the original owners no longer need. We buy them from libraries and thrift stores and schools. We do this at scale – hundreds of millions of pounds of books per year. We comb through these cast-offs looking for books that we know our customers will love. We add the best books to our inventory. The rest we recycle. We list our inventory on thriftbooks.com where people can find the lowest-priced books on the internet. We also sell on third-party platforms like Amazon and eBay.  We began in 2003 with a small storage unit in Seattle and have grown to over seven million books in seven fulfillment centers across the United States. About the Position We are looking for a senior data analyst engineer with a wide variety of skills to meet a wide variety of challenges. You will work closely on both the supply and demand side of data and will work equal parts as a business analyst, software engineer, report developer, and data engineer. You will respond to needs from developers and business stakeholders. Some days you will spend alone with your data. Other days you will spend talking to people about what they need or clarifying the scope of problems that are not well understood. Other days you’ll spend educating stakeholders or documenting what our data means and how it’s organized.  Our ideal candidate will likely have at least 5 years’ experience manipulating, analyzing, interpreting, preparing, gathering, simplifying, transforming, and presenting data stored in SQL databases.  You must have most (if not all) of the following qualifications: Experience analyzing and finding trends in SQL dataExpert-level experience in SQL querying – you should be fluent in SQL, maneuvering effortlessly in the languageExpert writing stored procedures – Much of our ETL and current reporting ecosystem is in stored procs, not SSISExperience as a software engineer – C#, Java or Python preferred; Git concepts valuedExperience with reporting tools like Power BI. And creating data warehouses that feed into BI toolsWillingness to work on whatever it takes (with whomever it takes) to solve problems having to do with our data.Insatiable curiosity. If you’re not intrigued by unsolved data problems or if you find it easy to let go of analysis b/c it’s 5:00 and time to go home, this job is probably not for you. We don’t want you over-working, but if it’s uncomfortable for you to leave a problem unsolved and you can’t wait to get back to it, that’s a good sign you’re a fit for this job.The ability to simplify - to get to the root of what someone is trying to explain to you. To consolidate duplicate data or code. To hear what people are saying and to distill it down to what they actually need.What to Expect @ Thrift Books:Small Company Feel: We have about 50 people in our corporate offices. It’s a small enough group that you’ll get to know everybody and see how the company works. For many of us, that’s a lot of fun.Stability: We've been in business for over 15 years. We have 900+ employees across the country. We are profitable and growing.Nice Commute: We’re centrally located (near Southcenter Mall) at the intersection of I-5 and 405 S, about ½ hour commute from Bellevue, Seattle and Tacoma, and commutable by bus.Visibility: We are small enough that you will see how your contributions directly affect the bottom line of the business.Technology: We are both a web company (thriftbooks.com), and a logistics company (managing millions of books in seven distribution centers across the country). We sell in a market that is very competitive and we use technology as a competitive advantage.Flexibility: We like our team to be physically in the office. That's how we interact and build and learn. But we value flexibility. We work from home up to once a week and we have flexible work hours.Organization: We've all been at companies where everything is a fire drill. Thrift Books is not that company.Opportunities to Grow: We encourage learning. We give ourselves time (and resources) to take in-person or online classes or explore recent technologies. That time is baked into every sprint. We try new ideas and we keep the ones that work.","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=1921&ao=4120&s=58&guid=0000016767a2e9e28e1afd53541b9ae6&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_30eae0de&cb=1543631989730&jobListingId=3036281028"

"Senior Data Analyst Engineer","ThriftBooks","Seattle","WA","$53k-$70k(Glassdoor Est.)"," DescriptionAbout ThriftBooks At its most basic, ThriftBooks is a Seattle-based data-driven online second-hand book store. That’s a mouthful. Let us explain …  We buy used books that the original owners no longer need. We buy them from libraries and thrift stores and schools. We do this at scale – hundreds of millions of pounds of books per year. We comb through these cast-offs looking for books that we know our customers will love. We add the best books to our inventory. The rest we recycle. We list our inventory on thriftbooks.com where people can find the lowest-priced books on the internet. We also sell on third-party platforms like Amazon and eBay.  We began in 2003 with a small storage unit in Seattle and have grown to over seven million books in seven fulfillment centers across the United States. About the Position We are looking for a senior data analyst engineer with a wide variety of skills to meet a wide variety of challenges. You will work closely on both the supply and demand side of data and will work equal parts as a business analyst, software engineer, report developer, and data engineer. You will respond to needs from developers and business stakeholders. Some days you will spend alone with your data. Other days you will spend talking to people about what they need or clarifying the scope of problems that are not well understood. Other days you’ll spend educating stakeholders or documenting what our data means and how it’s organized.  Our ideal candidate will likely have at least 5 years’ experience manipulating, analyzing, interpreting, preparing, gathering, simplifying, transforming, and presenting data stored in SQL databases.  You must have most (if not all) of the following qualifications: Experience analyzing and finding trends in SQL dataExpert-level experience in SQL querying – you should be fluent in SQL, maneuvering effortlessly in the languageExpert writing stored procedures – Much of our ETL and current reporting ecosystem is in stored procs, not SSISExperience as a software engineer – C#, Java or Python preferred; Git concepts valuedExperience with reporting tools like Power BI. And creating data warehouses that feed into BI toolsWillingness to work on whatever it takes (with whomever it takes) to solve problems having to do with our data.Insatiable curiosity. If you’re not intrigued by unsolved data problems or if you find it easy to let go of analysis b/c it’s 5:00 and time to go home, this job is probably not for you. We don’t want you over-working, but if it’s uncomfortable for you to leave a problem unsolved and you can’t wait to get back to it, that’s a good sign you’re a fit for this job.The ability to simplify - to get to the root of what someone is trying to explain to you. To consolidate duplicate data or code. To hear what people are saying and to distill it down to what they actually need.What to Expect @ Thrift Books:Small Company Feel: We have about 50 people in our corporate offices. It’s a small enough group that you’ll get to know everybody and see how the company works. For many of us, that’s a lot of fun.Stability: We've been in business for over 15 years. We have 900+ employees across the country. We are profitable and growing.Nice Commute: We’re centrally located (near Southcenter Mall) at the intersection of I-5 and 405 S, about ½ hour commute from Bellevue, Seattle and Tacoma, and commutable by bus.Visibility: We are small enough that you will see how your contributions directly affect the bottom line of the business.Technology: We are both a web company (thriftbooks.com), and a logistics company (managing millions of books in seven distribution centers across the country). We sell in a market that is very competitive and we use technology as a competitive advantage.Flexibility: We like our team to be physically in the office. That's how we interact and build and learn. But we value flexibility. We work from home up to once a week and we have flexible work hours.Organization: We've all been at companies where everything is a fire drill. Thrift Books is not that company.Opportunities to Grow: We encourage learning. We give ourselves time (and resources) to take in-person or online classes or explore recent technologies. That time is baked into every sprint. We try new ideas and we keep the ones that work.","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2523&ao=4120&s=58&guid=0000016767a70e1c9a6380364468c9c2&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_741ac92f&cb=1543632261261&jobListingId=3036281028"

"Data Analyst","IHME","Seattle","WA","$50k-$67k(Glassdoor Est.)","The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications.  These positions position must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages such (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers.  Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available.  Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include: Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes. Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another. Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution. Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future. Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data. Responsibilities include: Research commandBecome familiar with substantive areas of expertise to understand the dimensions and uses of health data and the analytic underpinnings of different research streams.Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.Data management and analyticsProblem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimationMaintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analysesTransform and format data sets for use in ongoing analyses.
