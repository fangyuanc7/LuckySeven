More than anything, you’re interested; curious, detail oriented, and have excellent judgement. You appreciate the importance of converting data into meaningful and actionable insights. You are excited about understanding channel dynamics & customer behavior. And you’re into the idea of building a company that’s at the forefront of fashion and ecommerce.  Lucky for you, we’re just getting started.  We’ve hit reset at Tamara Mellon. On our own business, and in turn, the women’s luxury shoe industry. Tamara Mellon, co-founder and former chief creative officer of Jimmy Choo, is no stranger to success or rule breaking.

Shoes designed for women, by women, and made by generations-old Italian factories.  We are dead serious about disrupting the fashion world and being taken seriously about doing it. Tamara Mellon is a Series B funded company, backed by NEA (the world’s largest venture fund; portfolio includes Moda Operandi, Jet, Casper, Goop, Groupon, and Quidsi, among others). We’re one year in, and we’re not slowing down. This is luxury, without the bullshit, in a fast-paced, startup setting.
