Founded by Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, Partners HealthCare supports a complete continuum of care including community and specialty hospitals, a managed care organization, a physician network, community health centers, home care and other health-related entities. Several of our hospitals are teaching affiliates of Harvard Medical School, and our system is a national leader in biomedical research.We’re focused on a people-first culture for our system’s patients and our professional family. That’s why we provide our employees with more ways to achieve their potential. Partners HealthCare is committed to aligning our employees’ personal aspirations with projects that match their capabilities and creating a culture that empowers our managers to become trusted mentors. We support each member of our team to own their personal development—and we recognize success at every step.Our employees use the Partners HealthCare values to govern decisions, actions and behaviors. These values guide how we get our work done: Patients, Affordability, Accountability & Service Commitment, Decisiveness, Innovation & Thoughtful Risk; and how we treat each other: Diversity & Inclusion, Integrity & Respect, Learning, Continuous Improvement & Personal Growth, Teamwork & Collaboration.General Summary/Overview Statement:Our Health Innovation Platform (HIP) team is creating information technology (IT) infrastructure focused on fundamentally accelerating the rate of clinical innovation in healthcare. HIP will empower clinicians and investigators by facilitating the deployment of apps that improve processes, strengthen communication and bring the power of genetics and analytics to bear to improve the care of patients suffering from life threatening and debilitating diseases.Our expanding team is tackling some of the largest challenges in healthcare IT – integrating genetic and other new data sources into clinical and pathology workflows, deploying complex analytics-aware infrastructure into mission critical clinical environments, and democratizing healthcare IT. This position offers an opportunity to join our team at an early stage. Background:Clinicians in different areas across our healthcare environment identify ways in which care delivery in their areas could be improved as well as process changes requiring new IT support. The required functionality often involves bringing together disparate data and applying improved analytics. Effectively, they are in need of “apps” to assist decision making processes. It is often expensive to build, clinically validate and deploy this type of functionality in healthcare. The HIP team is focused on addressing these challenges. The team is creating a platform to simplify the development of this type of functionality in the healthcare setting as well as using the platform to develop needed apps. The potential to introduce positive change for many different kinds of patients is extremely significant. This critical role will substantially increase our development speed thereby bringing benefits to patients in need faster than would otherwise be possible. Principal Duties and Responsibilities:We are seeking a talented and experienced business analysis specialist. While the successful candidate will spend the majority of their time creating functional specifications and business requirement documents and artifacts as an individual contributor, this position requires an individual who has the skills to define the approach, processes and tools for the HIP team and the ability to manage others’ use of them. In addition, the position may require the direct management of others’ activities and deliverables in the area of Business Analysis. The candidate must be able to take responsibility for defining use cases, determining where in the user workflow functionality should live, and creating the documentation to record and validate the process design.You will be joining a small team and therefore must be willing to play multiple roles.
