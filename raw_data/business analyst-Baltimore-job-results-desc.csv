Their business is guided by two simple principles: They strive to give their customers the information they'd want if their roles were reversed.They only publish analysts whose advice and strategies they'd want their own families to read and to follow.They believe in offering a range of opinions. Experienced analysts, with their own unique investment strategies and philosophies, lead their franchise brands. As a result, they do not promote a single, unified view of the markets, but instead they publish a mosaic of opinions, recommendations, and strategies. This multi-franchise approach gives their work far greater breadth, creating more diverse opportunities for their subscribers. Their franchises are linked, however, by a continuous commitment to risk management and a contrarian approach to identifying investment opportunities. Across all of their franchises, they focus on investments that are unloved, ignored, or unknown. It is in these situations where having an informed perspective gives their subscribers the best risk-to-reward opportunities.
