While significant improvements have been made to LIBOR since April 2013, the absence of active underlying markets raises questions about the sustainability of the LIBOR benchmarks that are theoretically based upon these markets. In light of these challenges the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the Treasury Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to work with market participants to identify options for replacing US Dollar LIBOR. Similar committees exist or are being formed worldwide to address non-US Dollar LIBORs. Last summer the UKs Financial Conduct Authority emphasized the urgency and importance of the efforts and implored industry participants to work in earnest on the transition to alternative reference rates that are based firmly on transactions.  As one of the largest LIBOR lenders in the world, the transition from LIBORs to a new series of benchmark rates will be a significant undertaking for Bank of America as it will impact almost every line of business and nearly all of our customers.

"Senior Financial Analyst","Diversey","Charlotte","NC",""," Whatever your interests, whatever your talents, at Diversey there's a special career that's right for you. One that meets your goals and the company's objectives. DIVERSEY HISTORY Diversey has been around for almost 100 years. Diversey Corporation was founded in 1923 in Chicago, U.S.A, and has grown internationally throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1996, it was acquired by Unilever. In 2002, the business was sold to the Johnson Wax Professional enterprise, becoming JohnsonDiversey. Johnson Wax Professional separated in 1997 from its parent company S.C. Johnson Commercial Markets, to become a global competitor. In 2010, JohnsonDiversey was bought by private equity company CD&R and simplified to Diversey, along with designing its new vision to create “a cleaner, healthier future.” Sealed Air announced that it was purchasing Diversey in mid-2011. Subsequently, Diversey has committed to its “cleaner/healthier” vision by becoming and remaining a leading global provider of commercial cleaning, sanitation, and hygiene solutions. The company´s products, systems and expertise have been making food, drink, and facilities safer for its customers by, for example, preventing food poisoning, reducing food waste, decreasing AHI, and building the pride of the people whose job it is to keep our world clean. Today, Diversey touches the lives of 800 million workers directly or indirectly. Our Next Chapter In late 2016, Sealed Air Corporation announced plans to spin-off its Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business within its Food Care division. The plan is intended to allow both New Sealed Air and the Diversey business to focus on a distinct set of strategic objectives, allowing the creation of enhanced shareholder value for both companies. Moving forward, under new leadership and with the investment of Bain Capital, Diversey is poised to transform itself and the industry to change the game in the way the cleaning industry creates value with digital solutions. We are seizing exciting opportunities to become a knowledge-based company selling more predictive solutions based on our Internet of Clean™ platform, robotics, and sustainability innovations. The Internet of Clean™ gives us a chance to radically transform the way the industry delivers value through cleaning, and is delivering huge benefits by preventing food poisoning, hospital acquired infections and other health related incidents. Diversey is very well positioned to lead the industry in this transformation and thus create significant career growth and wealth building opportunities for employees, and profits for investors and stakeholders.  Sustainability is in our DNA. From the day the company was incorporated to today, our commitment to protecting the environment, the communities where we operate and the safety of people who use our products has been second-to-none. Our guiding lights are our partnership with WWF in the Climate Savers Program, our social responsibility programs such as Soap for Hope, Linens for Life, and the Hygieia Network, as well as anticipated adaptation to new regulations. We have met or exceeded our own sustainability goals since we have kept records. And more importantly, we apply our knowledge and dedication to help our customers around the world achieve their own sustainability goals.  The Diversey business was recently acquired by Bain Capital and creates approximately US$2.6bn in revenues. Our 9,000 employees are globally dispersed across a broad footprint, with approximately 75% of revenues being derived outside of the United States. Our diverse team is lean, agile and highly collaborative. We are passionately results-oriented, and are guided daily by our values: Uncompromising Ethics, Courageous Determination, Ingenious Collaboration and Purposeful Innovation.
