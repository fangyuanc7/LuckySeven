Company DescriptionPhoenix NAP, LLC is a privately held organization of operational, networking and management professionals that have worked in the datacenter and IT fields since the early 1990s. The company employs a unique approach to providing flexible data center solutions that are tailored to meet the differing needs of small businesses and large enterprises  Phoenix is an ideal location for a data center because it is in an area not prone to natural disasters, there is a relatively low cost for power, and the city and region are very supportive of the high-tech industry. However, though Phoenix is home to numerous single tenant data centers, a lack of multi-tenant facilities in the area with available space and power presented a market need. PhoenixNAP is meeting that need while simultaneously addressing another market concern by establishing a true network access point for the city, state, and Southwestern United States region. PhoenixNAP operates a not-for-profit public peering exchange, enabling carriers to peer with one another to limit backhauling traffic to other cities across the country, and offer data center clients' additional connectivity options.  Through a unique approach to designs that maximize efficiencies, phoenixNAP is able to keep operational costs in check and pass additional captured savings on to its clients. PhoenixNAP has the available space, necessary power, efficient cooling, versatile connectivity, and multi-faceted security of a next generation data center.
