CPW collects fees for fish/hunt licenses, park passes, campground reservations, and for registering boats and off-highway vehicles. TLS (Total Licensing System) processes hunt/fish license sales. PARKS (Parks Automated Records Keeping System) accounts for sales of parks passes and for sales made through VRS (Vehicle Registration System) and CRS (Campground Reservation System). The primary goal of this project is to have an integrated parks and wildlife system that includes current and enhanced business functionality, upgraded technology that supports agency and public needs, and provides one-stop shopping for outdoor recreationists.  III. Current State  Wildlife Products  The current Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) Total Licensing System (TLS) is based on web and point-of-sale (POS) applications used to provide hunting and fishing license products, collect customer information, service customer information requests, deliver related products and information, and record transactions. TLS is currently used almost exclusively for the sale of wildlife-related products. The system stores customer and transaction information, provides reports, controls inventory information, records all accounting activities, and provides administrative control functions. Several systems supporting the licensing program have been created and are supported and maintained by in-house staff. Some of these systems are integrated with TLS and others are stand-alone in nature.  Parks Products  Parks products consist of passes to state parks, registrations of recreational vehicles (i.e. boats, snowmobiles, off-road), and campsite reservations and rentals. These products are currently provided through state parks locations[1], parks commercial retail outlets, the Internet, and by phone[2]. They are issued to individuals but are typically associated with vehicles. Limited personal identification information is collected for some parks product purchases which does not afford CPW the opportunity to effectively communicate with many parks product purchasers after they have made a purchase. There are four primary systems that enable and track the sale of park passes, permits, registrations, reservations, and other parks-related goods and services: PARKS - Parks Automated Record Keeping SystemVRS - Vehicle Registration SystemActiveWorks Outdoors/CRS - Camping Reservation SystemeStore - Electronic Store IV. Future State  The recent merger of the state’s Divisions of Parks and Wildlife presents the opportunity to provide sales of State parks passes, recreational vehicle registrations, and other parks-related products through the wildlife oriented system, which is scheduled for implementation over the next two years. The goal is to have a modified replacement system in place where CPW can present their products and services as one agency.  V. Senior Developer Qualifications  The successful candidate must be well versed in unit testing including test driven development, nUnit, Visual Studio, and other unit testing frameworks and tools. In addition, they must be comfortable creating mock objects, test harnesses, and other advanced unit testing strategies. They need to be able to demonstrate involvement in past projects including the aforementioned items.  We also require 5-6 years of experience as a software developer in progressively more complex assignments with experience managing requirements for software application development, service delivery, and customer satisfaction, or relevant experience in an IT applications/solutions delivery role.  The IPAWS APIs will be developed using .Net version 4 and C# . The senior developer must have experience writing T-SQL, web services and SSRS packages.","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=1721&ao=4322&s=58&guid=000001676617923d8dc099d5e23104ae&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_c5cef76a&cb=1543606080674&jobListingId=1794644106"

"Application system analyst","System Soft Technologies","Denver","CO","$46k-$88k(Glassdoor Est.)","*** Local Candidates only please. Must work in Denver and be available for an in person interview. **** Note: This position is currently funded for 3 months but may last as long as 8 months. I. Introduction  The State of Colorado Parks and Wildlife division with the Governor’s office of Information technology (OIT) is seeking a qualified Contractor to serve as a Senior Developer during the API development, unit testing and integration testing phase of the Integrated Parks and Wildlife System Project (IPAWS) project. This document outlines the project and the qualifications for the Senior Developer.  II. Background  Integrated Parks and Wildlife System Project (IPAWS)  Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) was created in 2011 from the merger of State Parks and the Division of Wildlife. CPW collects fees for fish/hunt licenses, park passes, campground reservations, and for registering boats and off-highway vehicles. TLS (Total Licensing System) processes hunt/fish license sales. PARKS (Parks Automated Records Keeping System) accounts for sales of parks passes and for sales made through VRS (Vehicle Registration System) and CRS (Campground Reservation System). The primary goal of this project is to have an integrated parks and wildlife system that includes current and enhanced business functionality, upgraded technology that supports agency and public needs, and provides one-stop shopping for outdoor recreationists.  III. Current State  Wildlife Products  The current Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) Total Licensing System (TLS) is based on web and point-of-sale (POS) applications used to provide hunting and fishing license products, collect customer information, service customer information requests, deliver related products and information, and record transactions. TLS is currently used almost exclusively for the sale of wildlife-related products. The system stores customer and transaction information, provides reports, controls inventory information, records all accounting activities, and provides administrative control functions. Several systems supporting the licensing program have been created and are supported and maintained by in-house staff. Some of these systems are integrated with TLS and others are stand-alone in nature.  Parks Products  Parks products consist of passes to state parks, registrations of recreational vehicles (i.e. boats, snowmobiles, off-road), and campsite reservations and rentals. These products are currently provided through state parks locations[1], parks commercial retail outlets, the Internet, and by phone[2]. They are issued to individuals but are typically associated with vehicles. Limited personal identification information is collected for some parks product purchases which does not afford CPW the opportunity to effectively communicate with many parks product purchasers after they have made a purchase. There are four primary systems that enable and track the sale of park passes, permits, registrations, reservations, and other parks-related goods and services: PARKS - Parks Automated Record Keeping SystemVRS - Vehicle Registration SystemActiveWorks Outdoors/CRS - Camping Reservation SystemeStore - Electronic Store IV. Future State  The recent merger of the state’s Divisions of Parks and Wildlife presents the opportunity to provide sales of State parks passes, recreational vehicle registrations, and other parks-related products through the wildlife oriented system, which is scheduled for implementation over the next two years. The goal is to have a modified replacement system in place where CPW can present their products and services as one agency.  V. Senior Developer Qualifications  The successful candidate must be well versed in unit testing including test driven development, nUnit, Visual Studio, and other unit testing frameworks and tools. In addition, they must be comfortable creating mock objects, test harnesses, and other advanced unit testing strategies. They need to be able to demonstrate involvement in past projects including the aforementioned items.  We also require 5-6 years of experience as a software developer in progressively more complex assignments with experience managing requirements for software application development, service delivery, and customer satisfaction, or relevant experience in an IT applications/solutions delivery role.  The IPAWS APIs will be developed using .Net version 4 and C# . The senior developer must have experience writing T-SQL, web services and SSRS packages.","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2009&ao=4322&s=58&guid=000001676619c8fd8bed8dd89e674faa&src=GD_JOB_AD&t=SR&extid=1&exst=OL&ist=&ast=OL&vt=w&slr=true&rtp=0&cs=1_dec9db9e&cb=1543606225777&jobListingId=1794644106"

Whether it's for information, commerce, or entertainment, each of us has come to depend on what we research, discover, and share. Publishers those who create and curate content are what makes the Internet great. Yet these publishers practice their craft largely alone, in silos without reference points or insightful understanding about where they sit in the grand scheme of things. To add to the challenge, once a Publisher's content is in the wild, then the task of building engagement, growing a loyal following and enriching the engagement with that following can sometimes feel like shots in the dark or worse, a black box. Moreover, making money from their craft can be a complex task for any independent publisher who might prioritize generating content first and money second.  Sovrn believes that independent publishers are the Internet's vibrancy. As a partner and advocate to tens of thousands of independent publishers, Sovrn provides tools, technologies and services that help publishers (a) make money; (b) get distribution to grow their audience; and (c) access a massive data commons providing extraordinary insights.
